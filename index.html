<h1>Adventures in Tuscany</h1>
<p>This is a short chronicle of my visit to Italy. Click on the thumbnails to see a larger view of each photograph. Enjoy!</p>

<h2>Pozzarello</h2>
<p><a href="window.html"><img src="thumbnails/window_thumb.jpg" alt="view from the bedroom window" width="75" height="100"></a> The house we stayed in was called Pozzarello and it was built around the year 1200 as the home of the gardner who tended the grounds of the adjacent castle. The thick walls kept us nice and cool inside, despite the blistering mid-day heat. This is the view from our bedroom window.</p>

<h2>The Tuscan Countryside</h2>
<p><a href="countryside.html"><img src="thumbnails/countryside_thumb.jpg" alt="countryside" width="100px" height="75px"></a>This is the scene on the way to Montalcino (all roads lead to Montalcino!). It looks a lot like the scene on the way to Sienna, and the scene on the way to the grocery store. We were surrounded by beautiful countryside for most of our travels.</p>

<h2>Sienna</h2>
<p><p><a href="sienna.html"><img src="thumbnails/sienna_thumb.jpg" alt="view from the bedroom window" width="75" height="100"></a>The closest city to our villa was Sienna, about 30 minutes away. We spent many days exploring the steep and crooked streets, sampling the local cuisine at outdoor restaurants, and stopping in the dark and echoey Duomo to escape the sun.</p>

<h2>Sweets</h2>
<p><p><a href="sweets.html"><img src="thumbnails/sweets_thumb.jpg" alt="Sweet food" width="100px" height="75px"></a>A sweet dish forming a course of a meal; a dessert and sweet delicacies that the Sienese have created, in particular, of traditional sweets whose recipes and creation have have been passed down through the generations and centuries that to even consider a comparison is impossible..</p>

<h2>Cathedral</h2>
<p><p><a href="cathedral.html"><img src="thumbnails/cathedral_thumb.jpg" alt="A Cathedral" width="75" height="100"></a>A medieval church,The principal church of a diocese, with which the bishop is officially associated and dedicated from its earliest days as a Roman Catholic Marian church.</p>

<h2>Lavender</h2>
<p><p><a href="lavender.html"><img src="thumbnails/lavender_thumb.jpg" alt="Flowers" width="75" height="100"></a>A small aromatic evergreen shrub of the mint family, with narrow leaves and bluish-purple flowers. Lavender has been widely used in perfumery and medicine since ancient times and lavender is a plant that doesn’t need much work, except for keeping the fields clean. It doesn’t need to be watered, quite the opposite: it dies if the soil is too humid.</p>
